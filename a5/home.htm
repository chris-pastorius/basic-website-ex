    <h4>Question 1:</h4>
    <p>
        The JavaJam website uses hierarchical organization.<br>
        It is the most appropriate organization for the site
        because it offers simple navigation for the easygoing nature of the site.<br>
        It doesn't have an overabundance of pages, so to convert it to something linear
        or random would be inappropriate.<br>
    </p>

    <h4>Question 2:</h4>
    <p>
        Color and graphics have been well-implemented on the JavaJam website, 
        sticking to three or four colors. The images aren't distracting in the least.<br>
        Navigation in the form of a simple navigation bar at the top of the page
        is a highlight of the website that has been well-done.<br>
        Functionality is another aspect that has been implemented expertly, 
        all of the links work as intended.<br><br>
        In terms of Page Layout, the margins being set so there's so much 
        blank space on each side of the page is vaguely tacky<br>
        and could be set so the page fills the screen.<br>
        The website as of now feels very inaccesible to those with disabilites.<br>
        The website is not greatly designed for the mobile experience.<br>
        Other than those, I think it's a pretty standard website, it just needs little improvment.
